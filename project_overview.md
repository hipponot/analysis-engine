# Analysis Orchestration Engine - Project Requirements (Revised)

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### **Mission Statement**
Build a cloud-abstracted, scalable analysis orchestration engine that can efficiently process variable workloads including video analysis, transcription, and data correlation tasks while maintaining cost efficiency and ease of adoption.

### **Target Audience**
- **Primary**: Open source community and organizations needing flexible data processing pipelines
- **Secondary**: Research institutions and analytics teams
- **Adoption Goal**: Easy setup and contribution for DevOps engineers and data scientists

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirements

### **1. Cloud Abstraction**
- **Primary Cloud**: AWS (initial implementation)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Abstract interfaces with swappable cloud provider implementations. The immediate goal is a **cloud-abstracted** architecture, not full cloud-agnosticism, to ensure a clean and modular AWS implementation that can be extended in the future.
- **Future Support**: GCP, Azure through pluggable modules
- **Implementation**: Terraform modules with provider-specific backends

### **2. Orchestration Engine**
- **Platform**: Apache Airflow with Kubernetes Executor
- **Scaling**: Dynamic pod creation for task isolation
- **API Access**: RESTful API for DAG submission and management
- **Authentication**: OAuth/OIDC integration for production security

### **3. Kubernetes Infrastructure**
- **Cluster Type**: Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Node Strategy**: Mixed instance types with spot pricing
- **Autoscaling**: KEDA for queue-depth based scaling + cluster autoscaler
- **Scale Range**: 0-20+ worker nodes based on demand

### **4. Compute Workload Support (Phased Approach)**
- **Phase 1 Focus**: **AWS Batch** for large-scale, containerized parallel jobs.
- **Future Support**:
  - AWS Lambda for lightweight, event-driven tasks.
  - Amazon ECS for medium-sized, long-running container workloads.
- **GPU Workloads**: Dedicated GPU node pools (g4dn/g5 instances) managed via AWS Batch.

  - Tainted nodes: Only GPU workloads scheduled on GPU instances
  - Fast provisioning: GPU-optimized AMI for quicker startup
```

### **Performance Goals**
*Performance targets will be benchmarked and refined during development.*
```yaml
Task Startup Time Goal: < 3 minutes (general), < 6 minutes (GPU)
Throughput Goal: 100+ concurrent tasks
Availability Target: 99.5% uptime
Cost Efficiency Target: 60-80% cost savings vs. fixed infrastructure
```
